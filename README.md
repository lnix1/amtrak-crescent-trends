# Exploring Amtrak Ridership Trends Along the Crescent Line

The files and notebooks located in this repo are part of a project intended for publishing via my website: lnix1.github.io

The project aims to explore some recent ridership trends along the Amtrak Crescent route, which runs 1,377 miles from New York City, NY to New Orleans, LA. I was inspired to investigate the data while riding the full length of the route to visit family back in Louisiana. In particular, I chose to take a scenic way home (30 hours as compared to the 3.5 hour long equivalent flight!) and I realized along the way that I knew very little about ridership trends for Amtrak among states south of Washington, D.C. The Crescent line is a particularly interesting line which was much more popular that I had previously known, as was evidenced by the large numeber of fellow passengers who rode for most of the distance serviced by the line. However, I assumed that many riders must use the Cresent line for the short distances offered between intermediate stops. Given this hypothesis and a strong sense of curiosity, I sought to out my intuition to the test. What better way than with a bit of data and python driven data exploration at 2:00 A.M. on a train! All of the necessary files and code are here to reproduce my exploration and the final notebook will be converted to html and embeded in an article via my webpage as well.
